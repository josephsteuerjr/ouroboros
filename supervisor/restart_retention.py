"""What a stop may retain: the ONE predicate every shutdown consumer shares.

Manual Restart, Panic, graceful shutdown and a crash-storm kill all end this
server generation's processes. None of them may turn a SAVED pause into a
terminal, and the owner's manual Restart additionally keeps the never-started
queue HELD instead of cancelling it (owner Batch4 7A: "tasks on Pause stay on
Pause across Restart"). The Restart's cancel census, ``kill_workers``'s running
and pending handling, the snapshot restore and the unused-grant revocation all
read the facts below, so no consumer can disagree about which task is a saved
pause — the census that skipped a paused id and the kill that then terminalized
it was exactly the failure this module exists to prevent.

The durable pause row on the task result stays the authority (``budget_pause``
row, whatever its ``reason``). A hash-validated warm ``owner_wait`` sleep can
transfer to that owner atomically, marking its old wait ``retained``. This
adds no store or scheduler; quiz/review waits never transfer by analogy.

- ``saved``: a stored continuation source for the live attempt (``pausing``
  after quiescence, or ``paused``) and no active cancel intent — Stop wins.
- ``unused_grant``: a Resume grant the loop never consumed over such a source;
  the stop revokes it back to the pause (the next Resume mints a fresh one).
- ``request_only``: ``pausing`` without a source — pause INTENT that never
  reached its checkpoint. The stop interrupts it; it is never an exact Resume.
- ``""``: anything else, including a consumed grant (running work) and an
  unreadable row (no pause is invented from an unknown).

A never-started queued row the owner's Restart catches is held, not cancelled,
under the typed ``owner_restart_hold`` on the queue's existing non-dispatch
hold carrier (``events_budget.BUDGET_HOLD_KEY``); only an explicit Resume
releases it. Other shutdown doors keep their own queue policy — this rule is
not extended to them by inference — but a row an earlier owner Restart already
held stays held through them, like a saved pause.
