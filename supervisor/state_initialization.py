"""Is this data root new? The one durable answer ``init_state`` consults (#1307).

Two missing ``state.json`` copies used to mean "fresh install", so a lost or
unreadable state minted a new owner slot, session and cleared Stop. First
initialization is now positive: ``state/state.initialized.json`` records ONE
initialization identity (``pending`` before the first state is written,
``complete`` after), written by supervisor boot (or an isolated benchmark's
explicit seed before boot) before admission, and by an owner Reset (``pending``,
``origin=owner_reset``). It holds identity and phase only — no permissions,
no history.

With both copies absent the decision is:

- a ``complete`` witness: initialized before, state LOST -> refuse (unavailable);
- a ``pending`` witness: an interrupted initialization -> finish the SAME id,
  unless supervisor-run evidence appeared since (then refuse);
- no witness: create only when a fixed, non-recursive set of evidence that a
  supervisor already ran here is positively absent (a legacy root whose state
  was lost is recovery, not first boot);
- an unreadable witness or evidence probe: refuse; unknown never mints identity.

Bootstrap scaffolding that may precede init — empty ``state``/``logs``/
``memory``/``task_results`` directories, ``settings.json`` from onboarding,
the usage ledger import, a benchmark sentinel — is deliberately not evidence.
A root whose every trace was deleted is indistinguishable from a new one: that
is a disclosed residual, not proof of historylessness.
